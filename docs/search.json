    "text": "DISCRIMINATORY ACCURACY\n\nCentral paradox: “an exposure may be “strongly” associated with an outcome, but simultaneously have a very weak capacity for discriminating cases and non-cases of disease in the population”\n“For example, when we say that people with diabetes have a threefold higher risk for Coronary Heart Disease (i.e., OR = 3), we are implicitly using diabetes as a predictive test to classify who will, and will not, suffer from a coronary event in the population. However, contrary to popular belief, measures of association alone are inappropriate for this discriminatory purpose.”"
