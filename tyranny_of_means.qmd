## DO WE CARE ABOUT AVERAGES OR INDIVIDUALS? {.center background-image="images/blank-background.png"}
## WHEN DO WE WANT AVERAGE?
- People with the same observables can have very different outcomes
- Do we really care about group averages? Yes in some circumstances but no in others?
- Maybe not surprising that this Merlo is an Epidemiologist? In health, you’re likely to have a single patient in front of you and you want to know the probability of some outcome given observables
- Does this fit in your field?


## POPULATION THINKING VS TYPOLOGICAL THINKING {.center background-image="images/blank-background.png"}

## TYPOLOGICAL THINKING

- Adolphe Quetelet and the ‘average man’ – variance around the mean is noise/deviance from the ‘true’ value [@xieOtisDudleyDuncan2007]
- “In typological thinking, deviations from the mean are simply “errors,” with the mean approaching the true cause. That is, the true cause is constant, but what we actually observe is contaminated by measurement error.”
- See also @hackingTamingChance1990a

## POPULATION THINKING

- Darwin and Galton (eek!) - how some characteristic is distributed (i.e. its variance) is as important as the average
- “Inherent population heterogeneity… makes it futile to draw “law-like” inferences from statistical analyses in social science.” [@xieOtisDudleyDuncan2007]

## DOES IT MATTER IN PRACTICE?

- This primarily affects interpretation not estimation
- For a regression model, maths is the same for the two perspectives [@xieOtisDudleyDuncan2007]
- But thinking about the problem is different?
- Measuring a fixed but unknown beta with some error vs “observations of _y_ could differ from one another not only because of measurement error but also because they are inherently different members of the same population”

## DOES IT MATTER IN PRACTICE?

- I don’t think really many people now think in this typological way?
- Especially in the social sciences I think people are happy with the idea of ‘sampling variability’/irreducible error?
- But the same idea can trip us up interpreting regression coefficients


## CAUSAL QUARTETS

![From Gelman et al. 2023](images/causal-quartets.png){.r-stretch}
## CAUSAL QUARTETS

- So what? [@gelmanCausalQuartetsDifferent2023]
- "Variation among people is relevant to policy (for example, personalized medicine) and understanding (for example in psychology"
- "Variation across situations is relevant when deciding what “flavor” of treatment to do, for example with dosing in pharmacology or treatment levels in traditional agricultural experiments."


## A USEFUL TOOL FOR THINKING?

- The population thinking approach is useful encourage thinking along these lines – the variation is something that you can model explicitly if you want to
- Maybe you care about how much/the shape of the variability there is within a group once average differences are controlled for [@brunton-smithHowCollectiveCollective2018]
- By focusing on how people with the same observables vary we can avoid essentializing people? [@mccallComplexityIntersectionality2005]


## WHAT IF I HAVE A BINARY OUTCOME? {.center background-image="images/blank-background.png"}


## DISCRIMINATORY ACCURACY

- If you have a binary outcome, you're having a bad time

- Central paradox: “an exposure may be “strongly” associated with an outcome, but simultaneously have a very weak capacity for discriminating cases and non-cases of disease in the population” [@merloMultilevelAnalysisIndividual2018]

- “For example, when we say that people with diabetes have a threefold higher risk for Coronary Heart Disease (i.e., OR = 3), we are implicitly using diabetes as a predictive test to classify who will, and will not, suffer from a coronary event in the population. However, contrary to popular belief, measures of association alone are inappropriate for this discriminatory purpose.” [@merloTyrannyAveragesIndiscriminate2017a]

## SAME OBSERVABLES: DIFFERENT OUTCOMES

## WHAT ABOUT IMPACT? {.center background-image="images/blank-background.png"}


## WHAT ABOUT IMPACT? 

- The current push for focus on immediate impact (i.e how can our research lead individual orgs to do different things) rather than broader impact (influencing a policy design) means that we may need to think more about how the implications might be used at a more micro-level 
- Does all this mean that basing a call for some people (government? Charity?) to do something of a statistically significant beta is misguided?

## BONUS: MODEL FIT

- One area where our two regimes does matter is model fit
- In case of linear model, R2 is fraction of variance explained
- So the model in the high variance scenario will have a lower R2
