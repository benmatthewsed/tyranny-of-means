## DO WE CARE ABOUT AVERAGES OR INDIVIDUALS? {.center background-image=,"images/blank-background.png"}

## DISCRIMINATORY ACCURACY

- Central paradox: “an exposure may be “strongly” associated with an outcome, but simultaneously have a very weak capacity for discriminating cases and non-cases of disease in the population”

- “For example, when we say that people with diabetes have a threefold higher risk for Coronary Heart Disease (i.e., OR = 3), we are implicitly using diabetes as a predictive test to classify who will, and will not, suffer from a coronary event in the population. However, contrary to popular belief, measures of association alone are inappropriate for this discriminatory purpose.”

## SAME OBSERVABLES: DIFFERENT OUTCOMES

## WHEN DO WE WANT AVERAGE?
- People with the same observables can have very different outcomes
- Do we really care about group averages? Yes in some circumstances but no in others?
- Maybe not surprising that this Merlo is an Epidemiologist? In health, you’re likely to have a single patient in front of you and you want to know the probability of some outcome given observables
- Does this fit in your field?
